# 🚗 Car Price Prediction — My First ML Project!

Hey everyone! 😊  
I’m super happy to share my very first machine learning project — where I worked on predicting car prices using real-world data.

This dataset had cool stuff like mileage, horsepower, engine details, etc., and I tried to figure out how all these features affect the price of a car!

## ✨ What I Did

🔍 **Explored the Data**  
Checked which features matter most, played around with visualizations, and got a feel for the data.

🧹 **Cleaned it Up**  
Handled missing values, encoded the categories, scaled everything... basically got it ready for training.

🧠 **Built the Models**  
- First, I used **Linear Regression** to get started  
- Then tried **Polynomial Regression** to capture more complex patterns

📈 **Evaluated Everything**  
Used R² Score and error metrics to see how good my predictions were.

## 📦 How to Run This Project

1. Download or clone this repo  
2. Make sure `car_price_prediction.csv` is in the same folder as the notebook  
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code  
4. Run the cells one by one and explore!

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("car_price_prediction.csv")
